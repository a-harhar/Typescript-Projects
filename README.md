# Typescript-Projects
The code for these projects is provided here. However, it is missing the node modules folder, which is obtained through starting a react app. In order to properly run the code, the command "npx create-react-app --template typescript <name of project>" should be run in the terminal, and then the src file created must be replaced with the src file given here.
